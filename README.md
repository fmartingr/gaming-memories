## About

Gaming Memories brings captures from your games and consoles into one local,
organized collection. Browse everything chronologically, move through albums by
platform and game, or open a capture for a closer look without leaving the app.

## Highlights

- **One unified timeline:** Browse screenshots and clips from every enabled
  source in capture-date order.
- **Structured albums:** Navigate by platform, game, and nested folders.
- **Rich image viewing:** Zoom with a pinch, double click, or modifier scroll,
  then pan naturally with a trackpad.
- **Video support:** See generated thumbnails and durations, then play clips
  directly in the library.
- **Automatic collection:** Import from PC games, Steam, console exports, and
  Nintendo Switch 2 albums.
- **Safe imports:** SHA-1 collision suffixes prevent one capture from
  overwriting another.

## Supported Sources

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Flutter 3.47.0 or newer.
- Linux, macOS, or Windows with its Flutter desktop toolchain installed.
- [FVM](https://fvm.app/) for the included development commands.

### Build and run

```sh
git clone https://git.nakama.town/fmartingr/gaming-memories.git
cd gaming-memories
make setup
make run
```

`make run` targets Linux by default. Use the matching command for another
desktop platform:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `make run-linux` |
| macOS | `make run-macos` |
| Windows | `make run-windows` |

### Set up your library

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar.
2. Choose the folder where Gaming Memories should keep its library.
3. Enable and configure the providers you use.
4. Select the collect action in the page header to import your media.

## Optional Tools

Gaming Memories works without every helper below; each one unlocks a specific
piece of metadata or collection behavior.

| Tool | Used for | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FFmpeg** | Generating video thumbnails | Existing `.thumb.jpg` sidecars are used when available |
| **FFprobe** | Reading video duration and the start time of PlayStation 5 clips | Videos still play; PlayStation 5 clips use the end time in their filename |
| **ExifTool** | Reading Guild Wars 2 and PlayStation 4 screenshot dates | Those providers cannot collect screenshots correctly |
| **libmtp** | Collecting directly from a Nintendo Switch 2 over USB on Linux | Import a copied album folder instead |

For direct Nintendo Switch 2 collection, install the `mtp-folders`,
`mtp-files`, and `mtp-connect` commands. Open **Album** on the console, choose
**Copy to a Computer**, connect it by USB, and close or eject it from any file
manager first. Only one program can use the MTP device at a time.

## Provider Notes

### Battle.net

Battle.net discovers installed Diablo IV and World of Warcraft variants and
imports each game into its own album. On Windows, Diablo IV screenshots are
read from:

- `Pictures\Diablo IV`
- `Documents\Diablo IV\Screenshots`

On macOS, automatic World of Warcraft discovery asks for access to its
installation folder. JPG and PNG screenshots keep the date from their
filename; TGA screenshots are converted to PNG for gallery compatibility.

### Hytale and Minecraft

Hytale is discovered automatically on macOS and Linux in
`Pictures/Hytale Screenshots`, and its provider can save the bundled cover in
the library album.

Minecraft launcher screenshots are discovered on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Both supported Flatpak screenshot layouts are included on Linux.

### Consoles

Nintendo Switch 2 imports original `_s.jpg` screenshots and `_s.mp4` clips
while ignoring `_c` duplicates. Individual album folders, including the folder
for captures taken outside a game, can be excluded in Settings.

PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 use folders exported from the console. When
FFprobe is available, the PlayStation 5 provider dates a clip from its start
rather than the end time stored in its filename.

## Development

Run the complete formatting, analysis, and test suite with:

```sh
make check
```

Use `make help` to see every available development and build command.
